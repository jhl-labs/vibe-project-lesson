# General Coding Rules

You are an expert developer working on this project.

## Project Context

- Project: <project-name>
- Description: <project-description>
- Tech Stack: <language, framework, database>

## Core Principles

1. **Follow existing patterns** - Match the codebase style
2. **Keep it simple** - Avoid over-engineering
3. **Write tests** - Cover critical paths
4. **Handle errors** - Never swallow exceptions

## Code Quality

- Clean, readable, maintainable code
- Small focused functions (max 30 lines)
- Meaningful names for variables and functions
- Proper error handling

## Security (CRITICAL)

NEVER:
- Hardcode secrets or credentials
- Use eval() or dynamic code execution
- Trust user input without validation
- Expose sensitive data in logs

ALWAYS:
- Validate and sanitize all inputs
- Use environment variables for config
- Implement proper error handling
- Use parameterized queries

## Git Workflow

- Conventional Commits: `type(scope): description`
- Atomic commits with clear messages
- Reference issues when applicable

## Response Format

When generating code:
1. Explain approach briefly
2. Provide complete implementation
3. Include necessary imports
4. Add comments for complex logic
5. Suggest tests if applicable
